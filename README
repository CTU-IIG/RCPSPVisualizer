Authors: Libor Bukata (bukatlib@fel.cvut.cz) and Premysl Sucha (suchap@fel.cvut.cz)

The purpose of the program is to generate pdf files of precedence graphs, resources utililization, and visualization of statistical analysis.

Required software:
GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
GNU Bourne Again SHell (BASH)
GNU Linear Programming Kit (GLPK)
Latex for translating *.tex files to *.pdf files.
Graphviz required for graph generation.

How to install:
1) Update the Makefile file:
	a) Set installation path - variable INST_PATH.
2) Compile program: make all
3) Optional program installation (the program can be executed from the current directory):
	a) make install

How to use program (example):
1) Install either RCPSPCpu or RCPSPGpu program.
2) Install RCPSPVisualizer
2) Generate binary files with results, e.g.:
	a) './RCPSPGpu -if your_dataset/*.sm --write-result-file' (add your additional arguments)
	b) Move the files to e.g. Visualization/ directory, i.e. 'mv your_dataset/*.res ${INST_PATH}/Visualization/'
3) Generate *.dot and *.tex files:
	a) cd ${INST_PATH}
	b) './RCPSPVisualizer Visualization/*.res'
4) Compile pdf files by using Latex and Graphviz:
	a) sh GeneratePDF.sh Visualization/
5) Find the generated pdf files in Visualization/ directory.

Remark:
1) The standard datasets for RCPSPCpu and RCPSPGpu  can be downloaded from http://www.om-db.wi.tum.de/psplib/.
2) If you would like to visualize the results from your algorithm it is necessary to write a result file in the correct format.
The binary format is defined e.g. in the ScheduleSolver::writeBestScheduleToFile method located in the RCPSPCpu/ScheduleSolver.cpp file.
3) If you include the generated graphics in your paper please cite our original paper in your publication list.
